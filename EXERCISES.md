# Overview

This file represents a series of exercises that students can try to achieve. They
are divided into three categories to order them by difficulty.

All the exercises are possible and have been tested.

## Basic exercises

1. Change color of the tiles the user has inserted a value.

This exercise involve only sass updates. [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and
[CSS pseudo-classes](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp)


## Medum exercises

1. Render the src/images/logo.png at the top of the Sudoku board.

This exercise involve javascript and the way to import images, embedding them
into our code. Webpack is already prepared to handle it.

## Advanced exercises

1. Render the src/images/logo.svg at the top of the Sudoku board, adding unit
tests to ensure the logo is rendered properly in the application.

This exercise involve javascript and the way to import images, embedding them
into our code. Webpack is not ready to handle it.

It's recommended to install [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/ReactWrapper/find.html)
to make the test straightforward.
